# Prompt: Build a Developer Portfolio Website for Antarang Poogalia

Create a modern, professional, and clean personal portfolio website for **Antarang Poogalia**, a software engineer specializing in AI, full-stack development, and intelligent systems.

The overall design style should be:
- Techy + modern (developer aesthetic)
- Professional dev-portfolio look (like Vercel/Next.js templates)
- Light + dark mode toggle
- Minimal gradients, mostly clean surfaces
- Highly readable typography
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

Use React + Tailwind CSS for the codebase.
